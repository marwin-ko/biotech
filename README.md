## Terms
- Allele: 1+ alternative forms of genes that raise by mutation and found in the same place on chromosome
- Aptamer: oligonucleotide or peptide molecules that bind to a specific target molecule. E.g. DNA/RNA aptamers bind to DNA/RNA. E.g. Peptide aptamers bind to target molecules.
- Epitope: the part of the antigen molecule to which an antibody attaches itself.
- Hybridization: the process of combining two complementary single-stranded DNA or RNA molecules and allowing them to form a single double-standed molecule through base pairing.
- Nucleotide: organic molecules consisting of a necleoside and a phosphate. They serve as monomeric units of the nucleic acid polymers deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA). Essentially a DNA or RNA base. There are 5 nucleotides: adenine(A), thymine(T), uracil(U), guanine(G), cytosine(C).
- Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR): a method to rapidly make millions to billions of copies of specific DNA sample, allowing scientists to take a very smal sample of DNA and amplify it to a large enough amount to study in detail.
- Vroman Effect: protein adsorption to a surface where the highest mobility proteins generally arrive first and are later replaced by less mobile proteins that have a higher affinity for the surface.
